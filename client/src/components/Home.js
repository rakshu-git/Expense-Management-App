            <p>Tracking your spending is often the first step in getting your finances in order. By understanding what you spend money on and how much you spend, you can see exactly where your cash is going and areas where you can cut back.

                It’s easy to make this part of your everyday routine thanks to expense tracker apps that help you manage your money on the go. These apps certainly overlap with budgeting apps, but while the latter provides a big-picture view of your finances, expense tracker apps put more of an emphasis on your spending. These apps usually categorize your expenses and help you get a good idea of your purchasing behavior.

                Whether you want an expense tracker app that easily captures all your transaction data, one that automates the expense reporting process at your job, or one that holds you accountable by requiring you to manually input each one of your transactions, there’s an app out there for you.Whether a particular expenditure is classified as an expense, which is reported immediately on the business's income statement or whether it is classified as a capital expenditure (or an expenditure subject to depreciation), which is not an expense flow of funds statement. Though, these latter types of expenditures are reported as expenses when they are depreciated by businesses that use accrual-basis accounting- as most large businesses and all C corporations do.
                In economics an expenditure is when a company buys fixed assets that will create a benefit in the future, or when the company upgrades existing assets so that they can be used for a longer time. This constitutes an investment, as the benefits of the use usually last much longer than the fiscal year. Depreciation also happens: the cost that the company took to upgrade or buy the assets will usually not be deducted directly, in one year; depending on the form of calculation used, a part of the cost will be deducted each year, as a form of expense.
